# AI for Image Analysis – Workshop

Welcome to the **AI for Image Analysis** workshop! This repository contains all the materials, resources, and instructions you'll need to follow along with the session.

## 👩‍🏫 Workshop Overview

This workshop explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly **Deep Learning (DL)**, in **medical image analysis**. Participants will gain hands-on experience with:

- Medical image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Addressing dataset imbalance through data augmentation
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics
- Using transfer learning with pre-trained models like **ResNet-50** and **VGG-19**

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Image Analysis Tutorial.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook for hands-on exercises
- `Step-by-step Workshop Instructions.pdf`: Setup instructions and how to run the notebook in Google Colab
- `Handout-Guide.docx`: Quick reference on model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
- `Workshop.pptx`: Slides covering the theory and case studies used in the workshop

## 🚀 Getting Started

To participate in the hands-on portion of this workshop:

1. **Sign in to Google Drive**
2. **Access the shared folder** via this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IybfMZdyykOnHcofWLiUzSagrhrW5Gpl?usp=sharing)
3. Create a shortcut to the folder in your own Google Drive
4. Open the `Image Analysis Tutorial.ipynb` in **Google Colab**
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook and run each cell sequentially

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Fundamentals of AI, ML, and DL
- CNN architecture and how it learns from image data
- Classifying ultrasound breast images as benign or malignant
- Strategies to improve model generalization and fairness
- Cross-validation for reliable performance assessment
- Introduction to using pre-trained models

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy** – Overall correctness
- **Recall (Sensitivity)** – True positive rate
- **Specificity** – True negative rate
- **Precision** – Correctness of positive predictions
- **F1 Score** – Harmonic mean of precision and recall

> See the `Handout-Guide.pdf` for a complete explanation of each metric.

## 👥 Contributors
